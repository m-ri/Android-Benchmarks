# Android-Benchmarks

The goal of this app is to perform some benchmarks over Android.
Actually I'm performing benchmarks about SQLite's insertion in different scenarios, using different strategies.
Results are stored inside /resultsBenchmarks folder

Please run the .apk over your phone, take the file saved in "external storage"->Android->data->marco.mrm.trybenchmarks->files and commit it to /resultsBenchmarks folder
